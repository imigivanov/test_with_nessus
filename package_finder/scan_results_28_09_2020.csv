Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,

directories.","By calling the OPTIONS method, it is possible to determine which HTTP
methods are allowed on each directory.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

necessarily indicate the presence of any security vulnerabilities.","n/a","http://www.nessus.org/u?d9c03a9a

          <p>
                Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Debian systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled

                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           Configuration files in the <tt>mods-enabled/</tt>,
                           <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.

huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi

service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the same
memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-11477

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource
usage.

CVE-2019-11479

Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel
to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which
contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth
required to deliver the same amount of data.

This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the
minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default
uses the formerly hard- coded value of 48. We recommend
raising this to 512 unless you know that your network
requires a lower value. (This value applies to Linux 3.16
only.)

CVE-2019-11810

It was discovered that the megaraid_sas driver did not correctly
handle a failed memory allocation during initialisation, which could
lead to a double-free. This might have some security impact, but it
cannot be triggered by an unprivileged user.

CVE-2019-11833

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. A local
user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem
image, for example using a removable drive, might be able to use this
to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. A local user
with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain
sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version

CVE-2019-11477

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive resource
usage.

CVE-2019-11479

Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux kernel
to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which
contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the bandwidth
required to deliver the same amount of data.

This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the
minimal MSS (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default
uses the formerly hard- coded value of 48. We recommend
raising this to 512 unless you know that your network
requires a lower value. (This value applies to Linux 3.16
only.)

CVE-2019-11810

It was discovered that the megaraid_sas driver did not correctly
handle a failed memory allocation during initialisation, which could
lead to a double-free. This might have some security impact, but it
cannot be triggered by an unprivileged user.

CVE-2019-11833

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks. A local
user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the filesystem
image, for example using a removable drive, might be able to use this
to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
ensure that new connection names were null-terminated. A local user
with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to obtain
sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-2. Packages for PC architectures (amd64 and i386) are already
available, and packages for Arm architectures (armel and armhf) will
be available soon.

allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs
to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of

An issue was discovered in urllib2 where CRLF injection is possible if
the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first
argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the path
component of a URL that lacks a ? character) followed by an HTTP

CVE-2019-9948

urllib supports the local_file: scheme, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that blacklist file:
URIs, as demonstrated by triggering a
urllib.urlopen('local_file:///etc/passwd') call.

CVE-2019-10160

A security regression of CVE-2019-9636 was discovered which still
allows an attacker to exploit CVE-2019-9636 by abusing the user and
password parts of a URL. When an application parses user-supplied URLs
to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of
information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially
crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information
(e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host
than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed.
The result of an attack may vary based on the application.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
2.7.9-2+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.7 packages.

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the USB Video Class driver (uvcvideo)
did not consistently handle a type field in device descriptors, which
could result in a heap buffer overflow. This could be used for denial
of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10639

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel
virtual address. In Linux 3.16 this hash function is not used for IP
IDs but is used for other purposes in the network stack. In custom
kernel configurations that enable kASLR, this might weaken kASLR.

CVE-2019-13272

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace subsystem in the Linux kernel
mishandles the management of the credentials of a process that wants
to create a ptrace relationship, allowing a local user to obtain root
privileges under certain scenarios.

could result in a heap buffer overflow. This could be used for denial
of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-10639

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
packet IDs used a weak hash function that incorporated a kernel
virtual address. In Linux 3.16 this hash function is not used for IP
IDs but is used for other purposes in the network stack. In custom
kernel configurations that enable kASLR, this might weaken kASLR.

any user namespace) could use this for denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20836

chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem
supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead to a
use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a
conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel from user
mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.
This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It
has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative
execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel
does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3900

It was discovered that vhost drivers did not properly control the
amount of work done to service requests from guest VMs. A malicious
guest could use this to cause a denial of service (unbounded CPU
usage) on the host.

CVE-2019-10207

The syzkaller tool found a potential null dereference in various
drivers for UART-attached Bluetooth adapters. A local user with access
to a pty device or other suitable tty device could use this for
denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-10638

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the generation of IP
packet IDs used a weak hash function, 'jhash'. This could enable
tracking individual computers as they communicate with different
remote servers and from different networks. The 'siphash' function is
now used instead.

CVE-2019-13631

It was discovered that the gtco driver for USB input tablets could
overrun a stack buffer with constant data while parsing the device's
descriptor. A physically present user with a specially constructed USB
device could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops), or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14283

The syzkaller tool found a missing bounds check in the floppy disk
driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a disk
present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer,
possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device, with a disk
present, could use this to read kernel memory beyond the I/O buffer,
possibly obtaining sensitive information.

CVE-2019-14284

The syzkaller tool found a potential division-by-zero in the floppy
disk driver. A local user with access to a floppy disk device could
use this for denial of service (oops).

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

Denis Andzakovic reported a possible use-after-free in the TCP sockets
implementation. A local user could use this for denial of service
(memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

(CVE ID not yet assigned)

The netfilter conntrack subsystem used kernel addresses as
user-visible IDs, which could make it easier to exploit other security
vulnerabilities.

XSA-300

Julien Grall reported that Linux does not limit the amount of memory
which a domain will attempt to balloon out, nor limits the amount of
'foreign / grant map' memory which any individual guest can consume,
leading to denial of service conditions (for host or guests).

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.72-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

CVE-2018-20836

chenxiang reported a race condition in libsas, the kernel subsystem
supporting Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) devices, which could lead to a
use-after-free. It is not clear how this might be exploited.

CVE-2019-1125

It was discovered that most x86 processors could speculatively skip a
conditional SWAPGS instruction used when entering the kernel from user
mode, and/or could speculatively execute it when it should be skipped.
This is a subtype of Spectre variant 1, which could allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from the kernel or other processes. It
has been mitigated by using memory barriers to limit speculative
execution. Systems using an i386 kernel are not affected as the kernel
does not use SWAPGS.

CVE-2019-3900

usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack
overflow. An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause
a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15211

The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that could
lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to add and remove USB
devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
correctly if more than one device is bound to it. An attacker able to
add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

use-after-free. An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could
use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate that
USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker able to add USB devices could use
this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
sisusbvga driver could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker
able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service

CVE-2019-15220

The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver which
could lead to a use-after-free. An attacker able to add and remove USB
devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate USB
devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap buffer
overrun. An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free. The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15807

Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas) did
not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
expander. This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG). The
security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15917

The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
after-free. A local user with access to a pty device or other suitable
tty device could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15926

It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently validate
traffic class numbers in received control packets, leading to
out-of-bounds memory accesses. A nearby attacker on the same wifi
network could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

Layer toolkit.

CVE-2019-1547

Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this
is used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases,
it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead
of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a
group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where
all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used
then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which
may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation.
In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability
to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit
parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application
using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable
because explicit parameters are never used.

CVE-2019-1563

In situations where an attacker receives automated notification of the
success or failure of a decryption attempt an attacker, after sending
a very large number of messages to be decrypted, can recover a
CMS/PKCS7 transported encryption key or decrypt any RSA encrypted

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media

serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in

handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2015-8839

A race condition was found in the ext4 filesystem implementation. A
local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2020-12464

Kyungtae Kim reported a race condition in the USB core that can result
in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
cause privilege escalation, denial of service, or information leaks in
the L1 guest.

CVE-2020-8647, CVE-2020-8649

The Hulk Robot tool found a potential MMIO out-of-bounds access in the
vgacon driver. A local user permitted to access a virtual terminal
(/dev/tty1 etc.) on a system using the vgacon driver could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8648

The syzbot tool found a race condition in the the virtual terminal
driver, which could result in a use-after-free. A local user permitted
to access a virtual terminal could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-9383

Jordy Zomer reported an incorrect range check in the floppy driver
which could lead to a static out-of-bounds access. A local user
permitted to access a floppy drive could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-10690

It was discovered that the PTP hardware clock subsystem did not
properly manage device lifetimes. Removing a PTP hardware clock from
the system while a user process was using it could lead to a
use-after-free. The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10751

Dmitry Vyukov reported that the SELinux subsystem did not properly
handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media
drivers did not properly validate USB device descriptors. A physically
present user with a specially constructed USB device could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege
escalation.

CVE-2020-12114

Piotr Krysiuk discovered a race condition between the umount and
pivot_root operations in the filesystem core (vfs). A local user with
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability in any user namespace could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash).

in a use-after-free. It is not clear how this can be exploited, but it
could result in a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12652

Tom Hatskevich reported a bug in the mptfusion storage drivers. An
ioctl handler fetched a parameter from user memory twice, creating a
race condition which could result in incorrect locking of internal
data structures. A local user permitted to access /dev/mptctl could
use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12653

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate scan requests, resulting a potential heap buffer overflow. A
local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could use this to cause a
denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-12654

It was discovered that the mwifiex WiFi driver did not sufficiently
validate WMM parameters received from an access point (AP), resulting
a potential heap buffer overflow. A malicious AP could use this to
cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly to
execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these

handle validating multiple messages, which could allow a privileged
attacker to bypass SELinux netlink restrictions.

CVE-2020-10942

It was discovered that the vhost_net driver did not properly validate
the type of sockets set as back-ends. A local user permitted to access
/dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a stack corruption via crafted
system calls, resulting in denial of service (crash) or possibly
privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11494

It was discovered that the slcan (serial line CAN) network driver did
not fully initialise CAN headers for received packets, resulting in an
information leak from the kernel to user-space or over the CAN
network.

CVE-2020-11565

Entropy Moe reported that the shared memory filesystem (tmpfs) did not
correctly handle an 'mpol' mount option specifying an empty node list,
leading to a stack-based out-of-bounds write. If user namespaces are
enabled, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-11608, CVE-2020-11609, CVE-2020-11668

It was discovered that the ov519, stv06xx, and xirlink_cit media

serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service

keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in

execute code on a vulnerable system.

CVE-2020-12769

It was discovered that the spi-dw SPI host driver did not properly
serialise access to its internal state. The security impact of this is
unclear, and this driver is not included in Debian's binary packages.

CVE-2020-12770

It was discovered that the sg (SCSI generic) driver did not correctly
release internal resources in a particular error case. A local user
permitted to access an sg device could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2020-12826

Adam Zabrocki reported a weakness in the signal subsystem's permission
checks. A parent process can choose an arbitary signal for a child
process to send when it exits, but if the parent has executed a new
program then the default SIGCHLD signal is sent. A local user
permitted to run a program for several days could bypass this check,
execute a setuid program, and then send an arbitrary signal to it.
Depending on the setuid programs installed, this could have some
security impact.

CVE-2020-13143

Kyungtae Kim reported a potential heap out-of-bounds write in the USB
gadget subsystem. A local user permitted to write to the gadget
configuration filesystem could use this to cause a denial of service
(crash or memory corruption) or potentially for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 'Jessie', these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.84-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (filesystem
corruption).

CVE-2018-14610, CVE-2018-14611, CVE-2018-14612, CVE-2018-14613

Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported that crafted Btrfs volumes could
trigger a crash (Oops) and/or out-of-bounds memory access. An attacker
able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a denial of
service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-5108

Mitchell Frank of Cisco discovered that when the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)
stack was used in AP mode with roaming, it would trigger roaming for a
newly associated station before the station was authenticated. An
attacker within range of the AP could use this to cause a denial of
service, either by filling up a switching table or by redirecting
traffic away from other stations.

CVE-2019-19319

Jungyeon discovered that a crafted filesystem can cause the ext4
implementation to deallocate or reallocate journal blocks. A user
permitted to mount filesystems could use this to cause a denial of
service (crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
already has a link count of 0. An attacker able to mount arbitrary
ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19768

Tristan Madani reported a race condition in the blktrace debug
facility that could result in a use-after-free. A local user able to
trigger removal of block devices could possibly use this to cause a
denial of service (crash) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-20636

The syzbot tool found that the input subsystem did not fully validate
keycode changes, which could result in a heap out-of-bounds write. A
local user permitted to access the device node for an input or VT
device could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
memory corruption) or for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0009

Jann Horn reported that the Android ashmem driver did not prevent
read-only files from being memory-mapped and then remapped as
read-write. However, Android drivers are not enabled in Debian kernel
configurations.

CVE-2020-0543

Researchers at VU Amsterdam discovered that on some Intel CPUs
supporting the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions, part of a random value
generated by these instructions may be used in a later speculative
execution on any core of the same physical CPU. Depending on how these
instructions are used by applications, a local user or VM guest could
use this to obtain sensitive information such as cryptographic keys
from other users or VMs.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by a microcode update,
either as part of system firmware (BIOS) or through the
intel-microcode package in Debian's non-free archive
section. This kernel update only provides reporting of the
vulnerability and the option to disable the mitigation if it
is not needed.

CVE-2020-1749

Xiumei Mu reported that some network protocols that can run on top of
IPv6 would bypass the Transformation (XFRM) layer used by IPsec,
IPcomp/IPcomp6, IPIP, and IPv6 Mobility. This could result in
disclosure of information over the network, since it would not be
encrypted or routed according to the system policy.

CVE-2020-2732

Paulo Bonzini discovered that the KVM implementation for Intel
processors did not properly handle instruction emulation for L2 guests
when nested virtualization is enabled. This could allow an L2 guest to
